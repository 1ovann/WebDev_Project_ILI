  <h1>About John O'Reilly</h1>
  <img src="profile-pic.jpg" alt="Profile picture of John O'Reilly">
  <p>Meet John O'Reilly, the man behind Wheels on Fire. A car enthusiast since childhood, John has always been captivated by the roar of an engine and the curves of classic vehicles. With a penchant for precision, he spends his days tuning engines, polishing chrome, and making sure every car in his collection is in pristine condition.</p>

  <p>But don’t let his perfectionism fool you – John’s sense of humor is just as sharp as his eye for detail. Whether he's cracking jokes about his latest restoration project or helping clients find their dream car, he brings a playful energy to everything he does.</p>

  <blockquote>"I’m not saying my cars are perfect... but they’re pretty darn close."</blockquote>

  <p>From rare vintage models to modern marvels, John’s collection is a reflection of his deep love for automobiles. And he’s eager to share that passion with every visitor, collector, and enthusiast who stumbles upon his website.</p>

  <p>Got a question for John? <a href="contact.html">Drop him a line</a> – just don’t be surprised if he’s busy fine-tuning an engine!</p>
